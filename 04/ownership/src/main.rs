    //
    //

    // There can only be one owner at a time.
    // When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

        println!("{} - {}", s1, s2);
        // The ownership of a variable follows the same pattern every time:
        // assigning a value to another variable moves it. When a variable that includes data
        // on the heap goes out of scope, the value will be cleaned up by drop unless the data
        // has been moved to be owned by another variable.

        let str = String::from("this is test");
        take_ownership(str);
        // println!("{}", str); this leads to compile time problem because function takes ownership
        // of argument

        //    now what if we want take ownership back again
